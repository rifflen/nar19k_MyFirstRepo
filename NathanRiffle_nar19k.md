# Lab 1 ISC4221C Discrete Algorithms for Scientific Applications
## Nathan Riffle 
In this assignment, I reviewed some GitHub fundamentals that I had some experience with previously, and was able to create a GitHub account *specifically* for **school** use. 

I am happy to be back in school after quite a long break and am looking forward to fully committing myself to learning and growing through this course.
